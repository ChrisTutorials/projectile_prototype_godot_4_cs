# projectile_prototype_godot_4_cs
Project is end result of tutorial at https://youtu.be/uOXIZf7QFHg

Project / Tutorial was made using Godot 4.2 rc1 Mono Version https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-2-rc-1/
To get the debugger to work from this project, you will need to put your Godot exe path into launcher.json's program entry
where it says "program": "C:/Godot/Godot4.exe" change the path (on the right) to your exact Godot exe location.

My dotnet version was 8.0.10. .NET 6.0 and 7.0 should work too. I'd probably get 7.0 since 8.0 is a release candidate version.
